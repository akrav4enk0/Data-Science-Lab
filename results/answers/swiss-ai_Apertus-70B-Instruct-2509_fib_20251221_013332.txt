```python
def fib(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    elif n == 2:
        return [0, 1]
    else:
        fib_sequence = [0, 1]
        while len(fib_sequence) < n:
            fib_sequence.append(fib_sequence[-1] + fib_sequence[-2])
        return fib_sequence

print(fib(10))
```

This function `fib(n)` generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. It starts with a list containing the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1. Then, it enters a loop that continues until the list contains `n` numbers. In each iteration of the loop, it appends the sum of the last two numbers in the list to the end of the list. Finally, it returns the list of Fibonacci numbers. The `print(fib(10))` statement will output the first 10 Fibonacci numbers.
