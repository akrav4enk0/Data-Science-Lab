# Results

This folder contains summary artifacts generated by the benchmarking scripts.

## Folder
[/terminal-bench results](https://github.com/akrav4enk0/Data-Science-Lab/tree/main/results/terminal-bench)  

This folder contains:
- `terminal-bench_summary.csv` - summary statistics of the benchmark evaluation, including solved trails, unsolved trails, accuracy rates.
  
- `terminal-bench_analysis.png` - visualization of the `terminalbench_summary.csv` shown as `plot_terminalbench_results.py`.
  The code is in [/scripts/terminal-bench](https://github.com/akrav4enk0/Data-Science-Lab/tree/main/scripts/terminal-bench) . 
  
- [/runs_json] folder (https://github.com/akrav4enk0/Data-Science-Lab/tree/main/results/terminal-bench/runs_json), that contains all Terminal-Bench JSON result records, for example [`Apertus-70B-results.json`] (https://github.com/akrav4enk0/Data-Science-Lab/blob/main/results/terminal-bench/runs_json/Apertus-70B-results.json)

## Folder
[/fib_latency_benchmark] (https://github.com/akrav4enk0/Data-Science-Lab/tree/main/results/fib_latency_benchmark)

This folder contains:
- `fib_latency_mean.csv`  
  Report table: per-model mean latency (seconds) over **50 measured runs**, excluding **3 warmup runs**.

- `fib_latency_summary.csv`  
  Raw per-run log used to compute the means. Contains one row per measured run with: `timestamp, model, task, real_seconds, output_file`.

- [/sample_outputs] folder (https://github.com/akrav4enk0/Data-Science-Lab/tree/main/results/fib_latency_benchmark/sample_outputs), that contains a few examples of model outputs from the Fibonacci latency benchmark (based on custom script), such as [`swiss-ai_Apertus-70B-Instruct-2509_fib_20251221_013332.txt`] (https://github.com/akrav4enk0/Data-Science-Lab/blob/main/results/fib_latency_benchmark/sample_outputs/swiss-ai_Apertus-70B-Instruct-2509_fib_20251221_013332.txt)

## How these were produced

Fibonacci latency benchmarks were executed via:

```bash
CLEAR_RESULTS=1 MODELS="modelA,modelB" ./scripts/bench_loop_fib.sh "" fib 50 3
